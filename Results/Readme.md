The computational results are saved into six subfolders named by the data sets that are used for the computational tests.  In these subfolders, we clearly identified the related Table or Figure numbers with which these computational results are associated.  In these result files, the essential columns are named similarly to the notations given in the paper. Other than those,

PLTSET is the number of plants.

PRTSET is the number of products.

PRSET is the number of periods.

HBSET is the number of hubs.

LSCST is C_{pc}.

HBCOST is C_{hc}.

PRODV is the parameter coefficient for adjusting the deviation of production costs.

HBCSTF is the parameter coefficient for adjusting the deviation of hub operating costs among different periods.
